SingleFileSlideshow
===================

A single-file slideshow that runs in a web browser and can be used on a Web Server without server-side scripting

Setup is as follows:

   * Copy and paste the code below into an HTML file on your server/nas box in the root of your Photos folder (slideshow.html).

   * If you want a nice 'please wait' indicator, create one and put it in 'slideshow.svg'

   * If you are running offline, you may wish to download jQuery to your server and change the file accordingly

   * Start a web browser on the device you want to use for the Slideshow, and enter the URL of the slideshow - on my NAS box this is: http://192.168.1.234/media/Pictures/slideshow.html

   * Wait for a few seconds (it may take some time if you have a lot of pictures!), and then photos randomly selected from your entire library will be displayed every 10 seconds.

   * Currently the photos just appear suddenly when they are loaded. If you implement a nice CSS transition between them, please contact me - I'd love to improve what is here!
